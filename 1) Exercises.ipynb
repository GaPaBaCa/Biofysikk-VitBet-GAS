    "**Solution** : We consider the function $\\phi(x,t)$ which describes the spatial distribution of particles along the $x$ -axis at a given time $t$. Our objective is to demonstrate that this function satisfies **diffusion equation**, which governs the temporal and spatial evolution of diffusing quantities such as heat or particles. \n",

    "The **diffusion equation** is given by:\n",

    "\n",
    "To proceed with the proof, we decompose $\\phi(x,t)$ into two functions f(x) and g(x),\n",

    "Starting with $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}$. The function $f(t)$ can be written as $(4\\pi D t)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$\n",
    "Therefore, we could say we are trying to find:\n",

    " $${-\\frac{1}{2}} (4\\pi D t)^{-\\frac{3}{2}} 4 \\pi D$$\n",

    " $${-\\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{\\pi D}t^{\\frac{3}{2}}}}$$\n",
    " Thus, we have determined the partial derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $t$: \n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = {-\\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{\\pi D}t^{\\frac{3}{2}}}}$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = {{-\\frac{1}{2 t}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D t}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we compute the partial derivative of $g(x,t)$ with respect to $t$: \n",
    " $$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t}$$ \n",
    " Since the function $g(x,t)$ contains an exponential term, we apply the chain rule to differentiate the exponent: \n",
    " $$\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t}[e^{-\\frac{(x-y)^2}{4Dt}}]$$\n",
    "Given that the derivative of the exponential function is itelf multiplied by the derivative of its own exponent, we obtain:  \n",

    "Previously, we introduced the decomposition of $\\phi(x,t)$ into two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x,t)$. Now, that we have computed their respective derivatives: $$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} and \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t}$$ \n",
    "We can proceed to differentiate $\\phi(x,t)$. Since $\\phi(x,t)$ is defined as the product of $f(x)$ and $g(x,t)$, we apply the product rule:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\phi(x,t)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} [f(t) g(t)]$$ \n",

    "Applying the chain rule, we differentiate the exponent:\n",

    "We now proceed to compute the second derivative. \n",
    "Since the given expression consists of a product of two functions, it is necessary to apply the product rule. We define the function as follows:\n",

    "$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} i(x)= \\left(-\\frac{1}{2Dt}\\right)$$\n",
